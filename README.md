# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, glad that you are on my Github profile

Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Balaji, and I am a proficient full-stack developer with a specialization in frontend technologies.

Currently, I serve as the `Lead Design Technologist` on the Enterprise Design Language team at Sabre, an innovative travel company. My daily responsibilities include gathering design requirements for UI components, coding reusable, accessible, and pixel-perfect UI components using Typescript, writing unit and visual tests, monitoring team progress, inspiring and challenging team members, reviewing pull requests, ensuring component correctness, consulting with other product teams, and promoting EDL adoption.

My passion for frontend development leads me to continuously explore new libraries, as well as stay up-to-date with the latest standards, such as W3, TC39, and PE (performance engineering).

I am seeking collaboration opportunities with individuals and projects that are focused on preventing fraud and theft in the real world.

Feel free to inquire about UX, product engineering, conducting tech trainings, and interviewing people. You can contact me at `balaji@dhbalaji.dev` or find me under the alias `dhbalaji` on the internet.

As a fun fact, I have read many technical books and am planning to write a book focused on performance engineering. I am also actively running a technical blog at dhbalaji.dev and have a passive Youtube channel.

In my free time, I enjoy cycling and reading non-fiction books.

Thank you for stopping by.
