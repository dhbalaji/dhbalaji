# Hi there ðŸ‘‹! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm delighted that you're here!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Balaji, an experienced lead developer with a strong background in software development and a specialization in `frontend technologies`.

Currently, I hold the role of `Lead Design Technologist` at Sabre, an innovative travel company, where I lead the Enterprise Design Language team. My responsibilities encompass gathering design requirements for UI components, coding reusable and accessible frontend solutions using Typescript, overseeing unit and visual testing, monitoring team progress, inspiring and challenging team members, conducting code reviews, ensuring component correctness, collaborating with other product teams, and promoting the adoption of our design language.

My passion for frontend development drives me to continuously explore new libraries and stay up-to-date with the latest standards, including W3, TC39, and performance engineering (PE).

I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities with individuals and projects focused on combatting fraud and theft in the real world. I am also available to provide expertise in areas such as UX, product engineering, conducting technical trainings, and participating in interviews. You can reach me at `balaji@dhbalaji.dev` or find me online under the alias `dhbalaji`.

As a fun fact, I have an extensive collection of technical books and I'm currently working on authoring a book centered around performance engineering. Additionally, I maintain a technical blog at dhbalaji.dev and run a passive YouTube channel.

In my free time, I enjoy cycling and indulging in non-fiction literature.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my profile. If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out.
