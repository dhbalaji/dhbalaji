Hey, this is Balaji. I am a full stack developer specialized in frontend technologies.

-  🔭 I’m currently working as a senior software engineer at [Sabre, an innovative travel company](https://www.sabre.com/) on an enterprise webapp built on React Java stack.. Here are the things I do on a daily basis at work
    - Gather software requirements (attending meetings 😀)
    - Code the requirements and ship it within sprint (ideally)
    - Write automation tests to do functional testing (in addition to unit tests)
    - Lead developer teams (sometimes depending on size of module, its agile team right)
    - Do operations and application support (prod issues 🤞)
    - Of course defect fixes 🐛 & stand up meetings
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on cloud computing tech like GCP & PE (performance engineering).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with someone/projects which can prevent fraud/theft ⛑ in real world.
- 💬 Ask me about product engineering, conducting tech trainings, interviewing people.
